Book Library Management Program
This simple command-line program allows you to manage a library of books. You can perform the following actions:

Add books to the library by providing their details, including name, number of pages, and whether they are a novel or an art album.
Remove a book from the library.
Display the current contents of the library.
How to Use
Run the program.

Enter the details of the books you want to add to the library:

Book name
Number of pages
Type (N for Novel, A for Art Album)
If it's a novel, enter the type of the novel (e.g., FANTASY).
If it's an art album, enter the quality of the paper (e.g., GOOD).
After adding books, you can choose to remove a book from the library by entering 'Y' when prompted. If you choose to remove a book, you will be asked to specify which book to delete by entering its corresponding number.

The program will display the updated library with the remaining books.

Repeat steps 2-4 as needed to manage your library.
